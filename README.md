# Atom – terminal text editor

Atom is a hobby text editor implemented in C for Unix-like terminals. It draws
inspiration from modal editors such as Vim and focuses on providing a compact
codebase that can be compiled with nothing more than a C compiler and the
standard POSIX library.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- **Modal workflow** – switching between insert, view and command modes.
- **Terminal-native UI** – rendering and cursor control powered by ANSI escape
  sequences without external dependencies.
- **File manipulation** – open, display and edit plain-text files directly in
  the terminal.
- **Configurable foundation** – the codebase is intentionally small to make it
  approachable for experimentation and learning.

## 🏗️ Project structure

```
.
├── LICENSE
├── Makefile        # Minimal build instructions (gcc main.c -o main)
├── main.c          # Editor implementation and terminal helpers
└── output.txt        # Sample file for manual testing
```

The editor keeps its state in a central `Buffer` structure that holds the
document, cursor position and active mode. Terminal interaction relies on
raw-mode configuration via `termios` and a small set of ANSI escape sequences.

## 🚀 Getting started

### Prerequisites

- GCC or another C11-compatible compiler
- POSIX environment (Linux, macOS, WSL, etc.)

### Build

```bash
make
```

This produces an executable named `main` in the project root. Clean builds can
be enforced with `make clean` (add this target if you need it).

### Run

```bash
./main test.txt
```

Replace `test.txt` with any text file you want to open. Running the executable
without arguments creates an empty buffer.

## 🎛️ Controls (current state)

| Key(s) | Mode            | Action                          |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| `i`    | Viewing         | Switch to insert mode           |
| `Esc`  | Insert / Command| Return to viewing mode          |
| Arrow keys | Any         | Move cursor                     |
| `:q` + `Enter` | Command | Quit editor                     |

## 🧭 Roadmap

- [ ] Undo/redo support
- [ ] Syntax highlighting for C and other languages
- [ ] Status bar with file information
- [ ] Persistent configuration options
- [ ] Menu/command palette for discoverability

## 🤝 Contributing

Pull requests and issue reports are welcome. Focus areas include improving the
buffer management, expanding modal commands, and polishing the rendering loop.

## 💡 Portfolio considerations

This project demonstrates systems-level programming, terminal UI handling, and
knowledge of editor internals. Enhancing the feature set (undo history, syntax
highlighting, tests, documentation) and polishing the user experience will make
it a compelling addition to a portfolio. Highlight the aspects you engineered
from scratch—especially raw terminal handling and data structures—to emphasize
your understanding of low-level development.
